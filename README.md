# Bluetooth-ESP32-Game-Controller
I built a very basic Arcade controller using Bluetooth and ArduinoIDE so I could play old school arcade games on my laptop with a Joystick and button(s).
The code is based on the BleGamepad.h library https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad and the code example in Arduino IDE (File > Example > ESP32-BLE-Gamepad > SingleButton)

Retroarch (Interface where you can install emulators) download:

The code examples can be easily added to if you want more buttons or Joysticks. 
I was limited by lack of GPIO's on my ESP32.
